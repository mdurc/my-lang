Symbol Table design notes:

i32 x;
u8 y;
{
  struct MyStruct {}
  MyStruct z;
}


Scopes      : [ 0, 1 ]
Types       : [ (i32, 0), (u8, 0), (MyStruct, 1) ]
Variables   : [ (x, 0), (y, 0), (z, 1) ]


Lookup type from string "MyStruct":
- I am in scope 1
- Iterate through Types and match the type name

Lookup variable from string "z":
- I am in scope 1
- Iterate through variables and match for name

Both lookups are Theta(n)
Both insertions are O(1)


==
Scopes : [ {T: i32, u8 ; V: x, y}, {T: MyStruct ; V: z} ]

Lookup type from string "MyStruct":
- I am in scope 1
- Go to scope one {T: MyStruct ; V: z}
- Iterate through types and compare, if it doesn't exist, go to the parent

Lookup variable from string "z":
- I am in scope 1
- Go to scope one {T: MyStruct ; V: z}
- Iterate through declared variables in scope 1 and match by name

Common case is faster during lookup O(n)
Insertion still O(1)


Grammar notes:
- Statements do not exist on rhs

Scoping Rules:
- Functions
  - Parameters and block all in the same scope
- Blocks
  - Scoped in everything except when attached to function
- For/While loops
  - Parameter scopes with inner block scope
- Struct
  - field scopes
  - Literal arguments scope


- Symbol Table Snapshot Testing
- Should I remove all optionals and instead use U0_TYPE? This way type inferring will have a type, and it will actually be associated to a type.
  - I should be associating NullLiteralNode type to U0_TYPE

Type checker:
- Identifiers are expressions, thus they have a resolved type
- Variable declarations have a type as a part of the Node, thus the identifier's resolved type will equal that one.
  - Note that we can set that resolved type to that identifier, but what is stored in the symbol table is a 'Variable', thus we have to mark that one as well, so that when we reach an identifier we can access the resolved type from the symtab


== TODO ==
- Structs improvements:
  - Handling/supporting data types other than i64
  - Supporting member functions within structs
- Parameter ownership (copying vs referencing)
  - Make sure that regular assignment performs copying
  - Referencing will only be possible through params. Note that ptrs can always be used to simulate references.
- Floats.
